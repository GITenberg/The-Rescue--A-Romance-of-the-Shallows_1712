description: "The Rescue, A Romance of the Shallows (1920) is one of Joseph Conrad's\
  \ works contained in The Lingard Trilogy, a group of novels based on Conrad's experience\
  \ as mate on the steamer Vidar. Although it was the last of the three novels to\
  \ be published, after Almayer's Folly (1895) and An Outcast of the Islands (1896),\
  \ the events related in the novel precede those. The story follows Captain Tom Lingard,\
  \ the recurring protagonist of The Lingard Trilogy, who was on his way to help a\
  \ native friend regain his land when he falls in love with a married woman whose\
  \ yacht he saves from foundering.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
